# E-Commerce-Web-Store-Watches-


Welcome to Chronix, a beautifully designed, front-end e-commerce experience for a modern watch store. This project was built from the ground up using only **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, demonstrating core web development principles without reliance on frameworks or backend services. All data, including the shopping cart and user preferences, is managed client-side using `localStorage`.

**Live Demo:** `[Link to your deployed website here]`
